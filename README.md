# chess3000 ♟️

## About the game

chess3000 is a fun twist on regular chess where players build their own armies before the game 🏰. Each player gets a point budget to select their pieces 💰. This creates unique matchups as players secretly choose their pieces, hidden from their opponent 🌫️. Once armies are set, the game follows standard chess rules ✨.

## About the repo

This project is a based on a fancy [effector-vike-react template](https://github.com/effector/vike-react-template), combining SSR and SPA techniques, and [FSD](https://github.com/feature-sliced)-like architecture 🤓 with the aim to show off 💅 and to keep myself in shape in the fast running 👟 world of web technologies 💫🌎💫
